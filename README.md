# Morse-Code-Translator
Here is a translator that I constructor which takes  letters, words and sentences as an input, and is able to translate emglish into morse-code as an output. 
This was my first foray into creating a functioning app using javascript and I'm very pleased with how it turned out. it uses if statements to provide the the translation and uses handle click functions to submit the answer and reset the input and output field. 

The process from start to finish splits up the the initial english input into an array of indivual letters, then using map and join iteration produces a new array of the more code equivalent as an output.

The technologies used in the production of this application were HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript.
