# Morse-Code-Translator
Here is a translator I made which takes english letters, words and sentences as an input, and is able to translate them into morse-code as an output. 
This was my first foray into creating a functioning app using javascript and I'm very pleased with how it turned out. It uses 'if statements' to provide the translation, and uses handle click functions to submit the answeras well as reset the input and output field. 

The process from start to finish splits up the  initial english input into an array of indivual letters, then using map and join iteration produces a new array of the morse code equivalent.

The technologies used in the production of this application were HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript.
